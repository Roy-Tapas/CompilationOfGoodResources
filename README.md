# Why am I here
## Who am I?
*I spent 19 years in financial services industries, by building, maintaining, and supporting IT applications.* **Over the years I built good understanding of banking and finance as a domain.**
Gradually I developed interest on data and analytics. I completed one-year course from IIM Bangalore, India to understand different type of analytics techniques and modelling from business perspective. I did this course before I relocated to US.
I also completed bunch of online courses including one that is taught by Andrew Ng. 
I manage my investment myself both in traditional investment world and in crypto in last 18 months. 

## What are my career goals?
I'm considering following options:
- Would like to join a financial institution to lead their digital transformation intiiative in order for them to stay relevant and competitive.
- Would like to explore converting my ideas to a product 

## Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?
All industries are disrupted by technologies. Modern technologies are completely reshaping customer engagement to backend services. Financial industry is no exception. They are the most disrupted and continue to be disrupted. With my career background in banking and finance and technology, this is the time to pivot into fintech. 
By fintech, it doesn't need to be a startup - rather I would like to help a traidtional and incumbent financial institution to fast catchup with latest digital trends.
